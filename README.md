Hi! I'm @apeltzer (Alex Peltzer)ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bioinformatician from Germany currently working as a principal scientist in TMCP TA Oncology at Boehringer Ingelheim and thus currently work mostly in Clinical Oncology projects these days.

I co-founded the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) community with which I'm still heavily involved as well as am still interested in all things around [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io). Previously, I worked on ancient DNA tools during my PhD, for which I have built and contributed to tools such as EAGER.

I am passionate about open science and developing best-practices for data analysis, tooling for reproducible research to enable scientists to deliver impactful work in a reproducible and well maintainable manner. This is also reflected in ongoing initiatives such as the [regulatory special interest group](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups/regulatory) formed within the nf-core community to foster harmonized standards for doing pipeline analysis work across both academia and industry using Nextflow and nf-core guidelines.
